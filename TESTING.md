🛑
🛑 In this section, you need to convince the assessors that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well.
🛑 Essentially, in this part, you should go over all of your project's features, and ensure that they all work as intended,
🛑 with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
🛑
🛑 Feature-by-Feature Testing:
🛑
🛑 Go through each feature of your portfolio site and detail the testing process for each.
🛑
🛑 Explain the functionality and demonstrate how it aligns with the intended purpose. This could include:
🛑
🛑 - Navigation: Ensuring smooth transitions between pages, links directing to the correct destinations.
🛑 - Responsive Design: Checking for compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
🛑 - Portfolio Display: Verifying that projects are properly showcased with accurate descriptions, images, and links.
🛑 - Contact Form: Testing the form submission process, ensuring the user receives a confirmation, and you receive the message.
🛑
🛑 User Experience Testing:
🛑
🛑 - Usability Testing: Have users (or simulated users) interact with the site and provide feedback. Document any issues encountered and the resolutions implemented.
🛑 - Accessibility Testing: Confirm compliance with accessibility standards (e.g., screen reader compatibility, proper alt text for images, keyboard navigation).
🛑
🛑 Compatibility Testing:
🛑
🛑 - Browser Compatibility: Testing on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.) to ensure consistent performance.
🛑 - Device Compatibility: Ensuring functionality across various devices (desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones).
🛑 - Performance Testing (optional):
🛑 	- Speed and Load Testing: Tools like PageSpeed Insights or GTmetrix to check page load times and optimize where necessary.
🛑 	- Scalability Testing: Assess how the site handles increased traffic or usage.
🛑
🛑 Regression Testing:
🛑
🛑 After implementing fixes or updates, ensure that previous features and functionalities still work as intended. This prevents new changes from breaking existing features.
🛑
🛑 Documentation and Logs:
🛑
🛑 Maintain records of testing procedures, results, and any bugs encountered along with their resolutions. This helps demonstrate a systematic approach to testing and problem-solving.
🛑 User Feedback Incorporation:
🛑
🛑 If applicable, mention how user feedback has been taken into account and implemented to enhance the user experience.

## Code Validation

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted)
🛑
🛑 Use the space to discuss code validation for any of your own code files (where applicable).
🛑 You are not required to validate external libraries/frameworks, such as imported Bootstrap, Materialize, Font Awesome, etc.
🛑
🛑 **IMPORTANT**: You must provide a screenshot for each file you validate.
🛑
🛑 **PRO TIP**: Always validate the live site pages, not your local code. There could be subtle/hidden differences.

## Responsiveness

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted)
🛑
🛑 Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site on various device sizes.
🛑
🛑 The minimum requirement is for the following 3 tests:
🛑 - Mobile
🛑 - Tablet
🛑 - Desktop
🛑
🛑 **IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the tested responsiveness, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.
🛑
🛑 Using the "amiresponsive" mockup image (or similar) does not suffice the requirements.
🛑 Consider using some of the built-in device sizes in the Developer Tools.
🛑
🛑 If you have tested the project on your actual mobile phone or tablet, consider also including screenshots of these as well.
🛑 It showcases a higher level of manual tests, and can be seen as a positive inclusion!

## Defensive Programming

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted)
🛑
🛑 Defensive programming (defensive design) is extremely important!
🛑
🛑 When building projects that accept user inputs or forms, you should always test the level of security for each.
🛑 Examples of this could include (not limited to):
🛑
🛑 Forms:
🛑 - Users cannot submit an empty form
🛑 - Users must enter valid email addresses
🛑
🛑 PP3 (Python-only):
🛑 - Users must enter a valid letter/word/string when prompted
🛑 - Users must choose from a specific list only
🛑
🛑 MS3 (Flask) | MS4/PP4/PP5 (Django):
🛑 - Users cannot brute-force a URL to navigate to a restricted page
🛑 - Users cannot perform CRUD functionality while logged-out
🛑 - User-A should not be able to manipulate data belonging to User-B, or vice versa
🛑 - Non-Authenticated users should not be able to access pages that require authentication
🛑 - Standard users should not be able to access pages intended for superusers
🛑
🛑 You'll want to test all functionality on your application, whether it's a standard form,
🛑 or uses CRUD functionality for data manipulation on a database.
🛑 Make sure to include the `required` attribute on any form-fields that should be mandatory.
🛑 Try to access various pages on your site as different user types (User-A, User-B, guest user, admin, superuser).
🛑
🛑 You should include any manual tests performed, and the expected results/outcome.
🛑
🛑 Testing should be replicable.
🛑 Ideally, tests cases should focus on each individual section of every page on the website.
🛑 Each test case should be specific, objective, and step-wise replicable.
🛑
🛑 Instead of adding a general overview saying that everything works fine,
🛑 consider documenting tests on each element of the page
🛑 (ie. button clicks, input box validation, navigation links, etc.) by testing them in their happy flow,
🛑 and also the bad/exception flow, mentioning the expected and observed results,
🛑 and drawing a parallel between them where applicable.
🛑
🛑 Consider using the following format for manual test cases:
🛑
🛑 Expected Outcome / Test Performed / Result Received / Fixes Implemented
🛑
🛑 - **Expected**: "Feature is expected to do X when the user does Y."
🛑 - **Testing**: "Tested the feature by doing Y."
🛑 - (either) **Result**: "The feature behaved as expected, and it did Y."
🛑 - (or) **Result**: "The feature did not respond to A, B, or C."
🛑 - **Fix**: "I did Z to the code because something was missing."
🛑
🛑 Use the table below as a basic start, and expand on it using the logic above.
🛑
🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Defensive programming was manually tested with the below user acceptance testing:

| Page | Expectation | Test | Result | Fix | Screenshot |

🛑 Another way of performing defensive testing is a simple Pass/Fail for each test.
🛑 The assessors prefer the above method, with the full test explained, but this is also acceptable in most cases.
🛑
🛑 When in doubt, use the above method instead, and delete the table below.

## Unfixed Bugs

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted)
🛑
🛑 You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed.
🛑 This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used.
🛑 Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding
🛑 implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.
🛑
🛑 If you've identified any unfixed bugs, no matter how small, be sure to list them here.
🛑 It's better to be honest and list them, because if it's not documented and an assessor finds the issue,
🛑 they need to know whether or not you're aware of them as well, and why you've not corrected/fixed them.
🛑
🛑 Some examples:
🛑
🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

- On devices smaller than 375px, the page starts to have `overflow-x` scrolling.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug01.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to add additional media queries to handle this, but things started becoming too small to read.

- For PP3, when using a helper `clear()` function, any text above the height of the terminal does not clear, and remains when you scroll up.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug02.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to adjust the terminal size, but it only resizes the actual terminal, not the allowable area for text.

- When validating HTML with a semantic `section` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug03.png)

    - Attempted fix: this is a known warning and acceptable, and my section doesn't require a header since it's dynamically added via JS.
